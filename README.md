The goal of the project is to create simple and documented templates for server-side applications,
in a variety of programming languages and technologies.


## We currently support:
**Node.js**: two server-side application are implemented. one base on RESTful, and the other on gRPC (HTTP 2.0) <br />
**Golang**: two server-side application are implemented. one base on RESTful, and the other on gRPC (HTTP 2.0)

Each server-side template includes docker support, test script and relevate Makefile.
