The goal of the project is to create simple and documented templates for server-side applications,
in a variety of programming languages and technologies.


## We currently support:
#**Node.js**<br />
**RESTful service** <br> a RESTful base service, written in Node using Express Framework. <br /> Includes webpack integration for ES6 support, Dockerfile for build stage, test scripts and relevate Makefile. <br /> In addition, the serivce is build with all basic Middlwares tamplets for auth validation, data validation and headers validation.

**gRPC service**<br /> a gRPC base service (ontop of HTTP 2.0), written in Node using Mali Framework.  <br /> Includes webpack integration for ES6 support, Dockerfile for build stage, test scripts and relevate Makefile <br /> In addition, the serivce is build with all basic Middlwares tamplets for auth validation, data validation and headers validation. <br />
As any other gRPC service, the source code includes a simple proto file for sample purposes.

#**Golang**<br />
**RESTful service** <br> a RESTful base service, written in Go using Gin Framework. <br /> Includes Dockerfile for build stage, test scripts and relevate Makefile. <br /> In addition, the serivce is build with all basic Middlwares tamplets for auth validation, data validation and headers validation.
